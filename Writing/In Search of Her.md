I find myself going to places only in search for someone that I don't know. 
It's as if Life feels worth living only when I find myself in love.
Yet I'm still afraid I'll keep looking for the one I loved in the one I'm looking for.
Am I really looking though? Or am I just desperately wandering for someone to lift my heart?

My brother still speaks of her as if it had just happened last night
He used to love strawberry, and yet he only eats pistachio ice cream now
